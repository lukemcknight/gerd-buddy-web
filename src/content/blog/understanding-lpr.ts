When most people think of acid reflux, they picture heartburn — that burning sensation in the chest after a heavy meal. But there's another form of reflux that many people don't recognize because it doesn't cause typical heartburn at all.

It's called **laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)**, often referred to as **silent reflux**, and it can go undiagnosed for months or even years.

## What Is LPR?

LPR occurs when stomach acid travels past the esophagus and reaches the **throat (pharynx) and voice box (larynx)**. Unlike typical GERD, where the main symptom is heartburn, LPR primarily affects the upper airway.

The reason it's called "silent" reflux is that many people with LPR don't experience the classic burning chest pain. The acid exposure happens higher up and in smaller amounts, so the symptoms feel different.

## Symptoms of Silent Reflux

LPR symptoms are often mistaken for allergies, sinus problems, or other throat conditions:

- **Chronic throat clearing** — feeling like something is stuck in your throat
- **Hoarseness** — especially in the morning or after meals
- **Post-nasal drip sensation** — a feeling of mucus dripping down the back of the throat
- **Chronic cough** — a dry, persistent cough that doesn't respond to typical treatments
- **Difficulty swallowing** — a sensation of a lump in the throat (globus sensation)
- **Sore throat** — recurring throat irritation without infection
- **Voice fatigue** — your voice tires easily or changes throughout the day
- **Bitter taste** — especially upon waking

Many people visit ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialists multiple times before LPR is identified as the cause.

## How LPR Differs from GERD

While LPR and GERD are both caused by acid reflux, they behave differently:

| | GERD | LPR |
|---|---|---|
| **Main symptom** | Heartburn | Throat/voice symptoms |
| **When it's worse** | Lying down, after meals | Upright, during the day |
| **Nighttime symptoms** | Common | Less common |
| **Heartburn** | Usually present | Often absent |
| **Throat symptoms** | Occasional | Primary complaint |

One important difference: LPR often occurs **during the day while upright**, unlike classic GERD which tends to worsen when lying down. This is because LPR involves acid mist or vapor that can travel upward even when you're standing.

## Why Tracking Matters Even More with LPR

Because LPR symptoms are subtle and easy to attribute to other causes, **tracking is especially valuable**. A symptom journal can help you and your doctor:

- Connect throat symptoms to eating patterns
- Identify which foods are most likely to trigger throat irritation
- Distinguish LPR from allergies or infections
- Monitor whether treatments are working

When tracking LPR, pay attention to:

- **Throat symptoms** — note throat clearing, hoarseness, cough, and voice changes
- **Timing** — record when symptoms occur relative to meals
- **Foods eaten** — same as GERD tracking, with extra attention to acidic and fatty foods
- **Beverages** — coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol are common LPR triggers
- **Body position** — note whether symptoms change with position

## Managing LPR

Many of the lifestyle strategies for GERD also help with LPR, but there are some specific considerations:

### Dietary Changes

LPR tends to respond well to reducing:

- **Acidic foods and drinks** — citrus, tomatoes, vinegar, carbonated beverages
- **Caffeine** — coffee and tea can trigger symptoms
- **Alcohol** — particularly wine and spirits
- **Fatty and fried foods** — slow gastric emptying
- **Chocolate and mint** — relax the lower esophageal sphincter
- **Late-night eating** — stop eating at least 3 hours before bed

Some research suggests that a **low-acid diet** (avoiding foods with a pH below 5) may be particularly helpful for LPR.

### Lifestyle Adjustments

- **Don't lie down after eating** — stay upright for at least 30 minutes after meals
- **Elevate the head of your bed** — even though LPR often occurs upright, this can still help
- **Stay hydrated** — water helps clear acid from the throat
- **Avoid throat clearing** — it's a natural response but can actually irritate the throat further; try sipping water instead
- **Don't whisper** — whispering puts more strain on irritated vocal cords than speaking normally

### Medical Treatment

LPR often requires medical treatment in addition to lifestyle changes. If you suspect you have LPR, see a doctor — ideally an ENT specialist or gastroenterologist. They may recommend:

- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) — often prescribed for a longer course than typical GERD
- Other acid-reducing medications
- In some cases, further testing to confirm the diagnosis

## The Path to Diagnosis

If you've been dealing with unexplained throat symptoms, chronic cough, or hoarseness, consider whether silent reflux might be the cause. Here's a practical path forward:

1. **Start tracking** — log your meals, beverages, and throat symptoms for 2 weeks
2. **Look for patterns** — do symptoms correlate with certain foods or times of day?
3. **See a doctor** — bring your tracking data; it gives your doctor valuable information
4. **Follow through** — LPR often takes longer to resolve than typical GERD, so patience with treatment is important

## You're Not Imagining It

One of the most frustrating aspects of LPR is being told nothing is wrong when you know something is. If your symptoms are real and persistent, advocate for yourself. Tracking your symptoms gives you concrete data to share with your healthcare team — and that data can make the difference between a vague complaint and a clear diagnosis.
