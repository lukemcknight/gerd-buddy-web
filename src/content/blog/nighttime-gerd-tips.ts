Nighttime GERD is one of the most frustrating aspects of acid reflux. Lying down removes gravity's help in keeping stomach acid where it belongs, which is why many people find their symptoms are worst at bedtime. Poor sleep makes everything harder — including managing GERD itself.

Here are seven practical strategies that can make a real difference.

## 1. Elevate the Head of Your Bed

This is one of the most effective and well-studied approaches. Raising the head of your bed by **6 to 8 inches** uses gravity to help keep acid in your stomach while you sleep.

Important: this means elevating the actual bed frame or using a wedge pillow — not just stacking regular pillows. Extra pillows can bend your body at the waist, which may actually make reflux worse.

## 2. Stop Eating 3 Hours Before Bed

Give your stomach time to empty before you lie down. Eating a large meal and going to bed shortly after is one of the most common triggers for nighttime reflux.

If you're hungry close to bedtime, a small, low-fat snack is much less likely to cause problems than a full meal.

## 3. Sleep on Your Left Side

Research suggests that sleeping on your **left side** can reduce acid reflux episodes compared to sleeping on your right side or back. This is because of the anatomy of the stomach — when you lie on your left side, the junction between the stomach and esophagus sits above the level of stomach acid.

It takes practice to change your sleep position, but it can make a noticeable difference.

## 4. Wear Loose Clothing to Bed

Tight pajamas, waistbands, or even snug sleepwear can put pressure on your abdomen and push stomach contents upward. Opt for loose, comfortable clothing when you sleep.

## 5. Avoid Your Known Triggers at Dinner

If you've been tracking your food and symptoms, you may already know which foods are most likely to cause problems. Save those foods for earlier in the day when you'll be upright for several hours afterward, or avoid them altogether.

Common evening culprits include:

- Heavy, fatty meals
- Spicy foods
- Alcohol
- Chocolate
- Citrus and tomato-based dishes

## 6. Skip the Nightcap

Alcohol relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter (the valve between your stomach and esophagus), making it easier for acid to escape. It also increases stomach acid production. If nighttime reflux is a problem, reducing or eliminating evening alcohol can help significantly.

## 7. Create a Wind-Down Routine

Stress doesn't cause GERD, but it can amplify symptoms. A calming bedtime routine — whether it's reading, gentle stretching, or deep breathing — can help reduce the stress component of your symptoms.

## Tracking Makes a Difference

One of the best things you can do for nighttime GERD is track which evenings are better and which are worse. Over time, you'll see patterns: maybe symptoms are worse after eating late, or after specific dinner ingredients, or on particularly stressful days.

That kind of personal data is more valuable than any generic advice list.

## When to Talk to Your Doctor

If nighttime GERD is regularly disrupting your sleep despite lifestyle changes, talk to your healthcare provider. Persistent nighttime reflux can lead to complications, and there are effective medical treatments available.

Don't wait too long to seek help — good sleep is essential for overall health.
